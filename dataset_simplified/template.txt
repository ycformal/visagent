The image shows a young man riding a brown horse over an obstacle. The man is wearing a white polo shirt, beige pants, and a black helmet. He is holding onto the reins with both hands and appears to be in the middle of a jump. The horse is galloping forward with its front legs stretched out and its tail flowing behind it. The obstacle is made up of colorful poles and there is a blue sign in the background that reads "Parking". The background is a grassy field with trees and bushes.

Output:
Thought(Analyze the result: I know the man is wearing a white polo shirt, beige pants, and a black helmet. No need to ask VQA because the two captions are fully consistent.

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the coffee mug. I need to locate it and figure out whether it is on top of a sofa. Analyze the caption: From the caption, there is a cup of coffee on the wooden table.
