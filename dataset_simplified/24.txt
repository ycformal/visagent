The image shows a desktop computer setup on a wooden desk. The computer monitor is turned on and the screen is blank. Next to the monitor, there is a white keyboard with a red sticker on it. On the desk, there are also a few other items such as a water bottle, a black coffee mug, and a black telephone. The desk appears to be cluttered and messy.
