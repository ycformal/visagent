Original program:

```
ANSWER0=VQA(image=LEFT,question='Are there only whole, unpeeled lemons in the image?')
ANSWER1=VQA(image=RIGHT,question='Are there only whole, unpeeled lemons in the image?')
ANSWER2=VQA(image=LEFT,question='How many lemons are in the image?')

ANSWER4=VQA(image=LEFT,question='Are there any lemons cut in half?')
ANSWER5=VQA(image=RIGHT,question='Are there any lemons cut in half?')
ANSWER6=EVAL(expr='{ANSWER0} xor {ANSWER1}')
ANSWER7=EVAL(expr='{ANSWER2} >= {ANSWER3}')
ANSWER8=EVAL(expr='{ANSWER4} xor {ANSWER5}')
ANSWER9=EVAL(expr='{ANSWER6} and {ANSWER7} and {ANSWER8
