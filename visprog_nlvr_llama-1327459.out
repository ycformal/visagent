In the center of the image, there is a white floating platform attached to the edge of the pool. The platform appears to be made of metal and has a curved shape.

The seal is in the center of the image, with its body partially submerged in the water. Its head is turned towards the right side of the pool, and its mouth is slightly open, as if it is about to dive into the water with its front paws. The water is a bright blue color, and the seal appears to be gliding gracefully through the surface.
