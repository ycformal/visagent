Program:

```
The program provided does not include the necessary steps to determine if the statement is true or false. It only checks if there are three side-by-side gray-and-white husky puppies in upright sitting poses in one image and if all dogs in both images are puppies. It does not consider the additional requirement that all dogs in both images are puppies. Therefore, the program cannot accurately determine if the statement is true or false.
