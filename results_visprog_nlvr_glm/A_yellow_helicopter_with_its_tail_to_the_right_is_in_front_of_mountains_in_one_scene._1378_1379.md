Program:

```
The given program is not a valid Python program. It seems to be a mix of Python code and some unknown syntax. The code includes variable assignments and evaluations, but it is not structured as a typical Python program with functions, classes, or modules. Additionally, the code uses the `VQA` function, which is not a standard Python function. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the statement is true or false based on the provided program.
```
Answer: Runtime error: 'program'
