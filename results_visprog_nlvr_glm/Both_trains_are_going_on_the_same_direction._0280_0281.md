Program:

```
The program provided is a series of logical steps to determine if a given statement is true or false based on the content of the images. Each statement is evaluated step by step using the VQA (Visual Question Answering) function, which takes an image and a question as input and returns a boolean value (True or False) as the answer. The final answer is obtained by evaluating an expression that combines the results of the previous steps using logical operators such as AND, OR, and XOR.
