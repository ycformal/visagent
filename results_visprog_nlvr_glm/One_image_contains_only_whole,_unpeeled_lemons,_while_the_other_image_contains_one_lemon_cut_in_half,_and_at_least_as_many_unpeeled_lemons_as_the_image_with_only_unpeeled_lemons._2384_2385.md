Program:

```
The provided program is a series of logical steps to determine the truth or falsehood of various statements based on the content of images. Each statement is evaluated step by step, and the final answer is determined by the result of these evaluations. The program uses a combination of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and logical expressions to analyze the images and answer the questions. The VQA function asks a question about the image and returns a boolean value (True or False) based on the answer. The logical expressions use these boolean values to determine the final answer for each statement. The program is well-structured and provides a clear step-by-step analysis of each statement.
