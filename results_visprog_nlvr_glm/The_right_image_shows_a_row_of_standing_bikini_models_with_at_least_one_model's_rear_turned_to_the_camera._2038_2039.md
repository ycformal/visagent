Program:

```
The provided program is designed to evaluate the truthfulness of a statement based on user input from visual questions and answers (VQA). The program uses a series of logical expressions to determine if the statement is true or false. However, without the actual images and the corresponding VQA responses, we cannot determine the truthfulness of the statements. The program is structured to take user input for each image and question, and then evaluate the logical expressions to provide a final answer. If you have the actual VQA responses, you can input them into the program to get the final answer.
