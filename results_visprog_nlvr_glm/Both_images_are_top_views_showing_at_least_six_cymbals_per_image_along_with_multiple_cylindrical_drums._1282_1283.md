Program:

```
The given program is not a valid Python program. It seems to be a set of instructions or a flowchart for a program that would determine if a given statement is true or false based on the content of two images. However, it is not executable as it is written. To make it a valid Python program, we would need to define the `VQA` function and the `RESULT` function, which are not standard Python functions. Additionally, the `EVAL` function is not a standard Python function either.
