Program:

```
The given program is a series of logical steps to determine if a statement is true or false based on the content of the images provided. Each statement is evaluated step by step using the VQA (Visual Question Answering) function, which takes an image and a question as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the answer to the question is true or false for that image. The results of each evaluation are then combined using logical operators to determine the final answer for each statement.
