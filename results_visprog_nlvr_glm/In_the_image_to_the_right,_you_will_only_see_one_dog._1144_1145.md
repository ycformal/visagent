Program:

```
The program is asking if the statement "In the image to the right, you will only see one dog" is true or false. The program is using a series of questions to determine if the statement is true or false. The questions are asking about the number of dogs in the image, if the dogs are in direct contact, if the dogs are posed face to face, and if there are at least two parrots in the right image. The program then uses these answers to determine if the statement is true or false. The final answer is "True" if the statement is true and "False" if the statement is false.
