Program:

```
The provided program is a series of steps that use the VQA (Visual Question Answering) function to evaluate various statements about images. Each statement is evaluated step by step, and the final answer is determined based on the results of these evaluations. The VQA function takes an image and a question as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the statement is true or false. The program uses logical operators such as AND, OR, and XOR to combine the results of these evaluations and determine the final answer.
