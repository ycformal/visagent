Program:

```
The provided program is a series of steps to evaluate the truthfulness of several statements based on the content of images. Each statement is evaluated step by step, and the final answer is determined by the result of these evaluations. The program uses a hypothetical function `VQA` to get the answer to specific questions about the images, and `EVAL` to evaluate expressions based on these answers. The `RESULT` function is used to get the final result.
