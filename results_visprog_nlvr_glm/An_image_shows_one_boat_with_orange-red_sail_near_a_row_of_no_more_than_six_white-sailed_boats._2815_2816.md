Program:

```
The program provided does not match the statement. The statement mentions one boat with an orange-red sail, but the program only checks for the presence of boats with orange-red sails. It does not mention the row of white-sailed boats or the condition of having no more than six white-sailed boats. Therefore, the program cannot be used to determine if the statement is true or false.
```
Answer: Runtime error: 'provided'
