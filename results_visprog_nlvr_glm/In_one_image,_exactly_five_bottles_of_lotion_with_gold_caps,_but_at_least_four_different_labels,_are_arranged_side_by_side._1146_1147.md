Program:

```
The program provided does not match the statement. The statement mentions "five bottles of lotion with gold caps" and "at least four different labels", but the program only checks for the number of bottles and their arrangement. It does not check for the labels or the gold caps. Therefore, the program cannot be used to determine if the statement is true or false.
```
