ANSWER0=VQA(image=LEFT,question='How many men are standing under the row of lights?')
ANSWER1=VQA(image=RIGHT,question='How many men are standing under the row of lights?')
ANSWER2=VQA(image=LEFT,question='Are there windows flanking double doors along the back?')
ANSWER3=VQA(image=RIGHT,question='Are there windows flanking double doors along the back?')
ANSWER4=EVAL(expr='{ANSWER0} > 1 and {ANSWER2}')
ANSWER5=EVAL(expr='{ANSWER1} > 1 and {ANSWER3}')
ANSWER6=EVAL(expr='{ANSWER4} xor {ANSWER5}')
FINAL_ANSWER=RESULT(var=ANSWER6)
