multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx480h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a young woman standing in front of an open refrigerator. The woman is bending over the door of the refrigerator, with her head down and her hands on the handle. She appears to be looking down at the contents inside the fridge."

Q="Are there either any small refrigerators or microwaves in the picture?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main objects in the question are refrigerators and microwaves. I need to find if there are either of them. Analyze the caption: From the caption, there is a refrigerator. Unknown or unsure: Whether the refrigerator is small. If not, whether there is a small microwave. Plan: I need to locate the microwave first.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='refrigerator'))
<result>
[[290, 2, 636, 479]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is only one bounding box. No steps need to be taken to filter false detections. Plan: Measure the size of the refrigerator. Note that the size of IMAGE is 640wx480h. The size of the bounding box is 346wx477h. It almost filled the image in height. I think the real height of the refrigerator even exceeds the image, so it must be large. Now locate the microwave.)
Implement(BOX1=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='microwave'))
<result>
[[290, 2, 636, 479]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The bounding box is the same as BOX0. I'm sure the LOC module mistakenly recognizes the refrigerator as the microwave, as the caption says there's a refrigerator but the microwave is not mentioned. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks if there are either any small refrigerators or microwaves in the picture. I know there is a refrigerator but it is large, and there is no microwave, so the answer is no.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='No, there is a refrigerator but it is large.'))
