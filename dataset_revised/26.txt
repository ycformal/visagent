CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a young man playing tennis on a clay court. He is wearing a white t-shirt with red stripes on the sleeves and black shorts. He has a pair of glasses on and is holding a red and black tennis racket in his right hand."

Q="What is the company the made the shoes called?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the shoes. I need to locate the shoes and figure out the brand. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions a man, but no information about the shoes. I guess the man is wearing the shoes. Unknown or unsure: Where are the shoes and the brand. Plan: I will first call LOC to locate the shoes.)

</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There are two bounding boxes, which correspond to two shoes. Plan: To know the brand of the shoes, I only need to focus on one bounding box. I'd like to choose the largest one. The second one is larger, so choose the second one. Now crop on BOX0[1].)
Implement(IMAGE0=CROP(image=IMAGE,box=BOX0,index=1))
<result>
The image shows a close-up of a person's foot wearing a pair of white sneakers. The sneakers have a metallic silver color with blue and black stripes on the sides. The laces are white and the sole of the shoe is white. The person is standing on a brown carpeted floor.
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: I know the shoes are sneakers, and I can see the details of the sneakers. From the appearance of the sneakers, I guess the brand is Adidas. Plan: Call VQA to ask the question.)
Implement(ANSWER0=VQA(image=IMAGE0,question='What is the brand of the sneakers?'))
<result>
adidas
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The VQA gives the answer, which is "adidas". Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks for the company that made the shoes. It's equivalent to ask for the brand of the shoes. I know the brand is Adidas, so the answer is Adidas.)
Implement(ANSWER1=RESULT(var='Adidas'))
