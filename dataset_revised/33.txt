Q="Does the elephant near the stones seem to be sitting?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is elephant. I need to find the elephants near the stones and figure out if one of them is sitting. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions an adult elephant and a baby elephant. They are both near the stones. The adult one is standing and the baby one is walking. Unknown or unsure: Nothing. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks whether the elephant near the stones seem to be sitting. I know the elephants are walking and standing, but not sitting, so the answer is no.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='No. I detected two elephants, but one is walking and another one is sitting.'))
