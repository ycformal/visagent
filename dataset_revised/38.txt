multimodal input: IMAGE (322wx500h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows the rear wheel of a bicycle leaning against a wall next to a window. The bicycle has a black frame and a brown tire with white spokes. The handlebars are black and the seat is black. The window is open and the view outside is of a street with buildings and trees."

Q="What is the name of the animal that is the same color as the container on the left of the image?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the container. I need to locate the container and find an animal of the same color. Analyze the caption: The caption doesn't mention anything about the container. Unknown or unsure: The color of the container and the animal of the same color. Plan: I need to locate the container first.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='container'))
<result>
[]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The LOC module fails to locate the container, and there is no search words better than "container". Plan: Directly ask VQA about the color of the container.)
Implement(ANSWER0=VQA(image=IMAGE,question='What is the color of the container?'))
<result>
white
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The VQA module gives the color of the container, which is white. Plan: I need to find an animal of white. Locate animals first.)
Implement(BOX1=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='animal'))
<result>
[]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The LOC module fails to locate the animal, and there is no search words better than "animal". Plan: Directly ask VQA about the animal.)
Implement(ANSWER1=VQA(image=IMAGE,question='What animals are in the image?'))
<result>
none
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There's no animal in the image. I guess the question asks me to enumerate an arbitrary animal. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks for the name of the animal that is the same color as the container on the left of the image. The container is white, so I need to find a white animal. I know the polar bear is white, so the answer is polar bear.)
Implement(ANSWER1=RESULT(var='polar bear'))
