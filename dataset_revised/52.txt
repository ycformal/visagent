multimodal input: IMAGE (500wx333h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a skateboarder in mid-air, performing a trick. He is wearing a blue t-shirt, khaki pants, and black shoes. His arms are stretched out to the sides and his legs are bent at the knees."

Q="Does the person to the right of the chimney wear shorts?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the person who is to the right of the chimney. I need to find the chimney and locate the person to the right of the chimney. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions a person but does not mention any chimney. Unknown or unsure: Where is the chimney, and what is the person to the right of the chimney wearing. Plan: I need to locate the chimney first.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='chimney'))

[[142, 42, 170, 73]]

Thought(Analyze the result: There is only one bounding box. Plan: Crop the right side of the chimney, so that I can locate the person to the right of the chimney.)
Implement(IMAGE0=CROP_RIGHTOF(image=IMAGE,box=BOX0,index=0))
<result>
The image shows a young man performing a skateboard trick in a park. He is wearing a blue t-shirt, khaki pants, and black sneakers. The background shows a colorful mural on the side of a building and trees.
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is a man in IMAGE0, but I don't know whether he is wearing shorts. Plan: Ask VQA whether the person is wearing shorts.)
Implement(ANSWER0=VQA(image=IMAGE0,question='Is the person wearing shorts?'))
<result>
no
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The VQA gives "no", which means the person in IMAGE0 is not wearing shorts. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks whether the person to the right of the chimney wears shorts, and I know there is a man to the right of the chimney, but is not wearing shorts. So the answer is no.)
Implement(ANSWER1=RESULT(var='No, the person is not wearing shorts.'))
