CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a group of people gathered around an elephant in a park. There are two people sitting on a bench in front of the elephant, one of them is holding a basket and the other is looking at the elephant."

Q="What is the woman that is standing doing?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the standing woman. I need to locate the woman and figure out what is she doing. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions a group of people. Unknown or unsure: Where is the woman and what is she doing. Plan: I need to locate the woman first.)

[[368, 223, 556, 431], [524, 157, 639, 326], [203, 231, 235, 299], [466, 144, 527, 293]]

Thought(Analyze the result: There are multiple bounding boxes. I need to filter out the wrong detections. Judge the size: The sizes for the bounding boxes are 188x208, 115x169, 32x68, 61x149. They are of normal sizes. Plan: Crop on the bounding box of the woman. However, there are four bounding boxes, so I first crop on the bounding box that is most likely to be the woman. Since the question mentions a standing woman, let's judge this by shape. [368, 223, 556, 431] has a shape of 188x208, and it is close to a square. [524, 157, 639, 326] has a shape of 115x169, which is a rectangular, and it might be a standing woman. [203, 231, 235, 299] has a shape of 32x68, also a rectangular. [466, 144, 527, 293] has a shape of 61x148, also a rectangular. So first choose a rectangular with the biggest size, [524, 157, 639, 326]. Let's locate on BOX0[1].)

The image shows a group of people gathered under a red canopy. The woman on the left is wearing a green t-shirt and is sitting on a wooden bench, while the woman in the middle is standing and holding a basket.
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: I know the question asks what the standing woman is doing. Now I already located the standing woman. There is indeed a standing woman in the image, and she is holding a basket. This is consistent with the previous caption and I can make sure the woman is in the question. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks what is the woman that is standing doing. I know there is a standing woman holding a basket. So the answer is the woman is holding a basket.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='The woman is holding a basket.'))
