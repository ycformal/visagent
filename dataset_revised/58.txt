multimodal input: IMAGE (500wx430h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a busy street scene in a European city. There are several buildings on the right side of the image, including a row of terraced houses with ornate architectural details. In the foreground, there are several cars and a police car parked on the side of a road. The street is lined with traffic lights and there are people walking on the sidewalk."

Q="Are there any traffic lights that are not yellow?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is traffic lights. I need to locate them and figure out their colors. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions the street is lined with traffic lights. Unknown or unsure: The color of the traffic lights. Plan: I need to locate the traffic lights first.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='traffic lights'))
<result>
[[475, 253, 492, 288], [231, 253, 252, 293], [295, 237, 325, 287], [287, 251, 302, 287]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There are multiple bounding boxes and I need to filter out wrong detections. Judge by size: The sizes of bounding boxes are 17x35, 21x40, 30x50 and 15x36. The bounding boxes of size 17x35 and 15x36 are too small. Filter them out. Plan: For the remaining bounding boxes, remove small ones that heavily overlap with a larger bounding box.)
Implement(BOX1=FILTER_INCLUDED(box='[[231, 253, 252, 293], [295, 237, 325, 287]]'))
<result>
[[231, 253, 252, 293], [295, 237, 325, 287]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There are two traffic lights. Plan: Crop them one by one and get the color. Crop on BOX1[0] first.)
Implement(IMAGE0=CROP(image=IMAGE,box=BOX1,index=0))
<result>
The image is a close-up of a traffic light. The light is rectangular in shape and has a white frame. The top of the light has a red light, which is turned on and is slightly blurred. Below the light, there are three black lights, which are turned on.
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: I know the first traffic light has a red color. It is not yellow. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks if there are traffic lights that are not yellow, and I know there is a red one, so the answer is yes.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='Yes, there is a red traffic light.'))
