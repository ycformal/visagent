multimodal input: IMAGE (500wx335h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a street market with a variety of items for sale. There are several tables with colorful items on them, including t-shirts, bags, and other souvenirs. A woman is standing in front of one of the tables, looking at the items. In the background, there are palm trees and buildings, and a few people walking on the sidewalk."

Q="Which kind of furniture do the dolls sit on top of?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the doll. I need to locate the doll and find the object it sits on top of. Analyze the caption: From the caption, there are items for sale on the street. It mentions tables with items on them. This is consistent with the question which asks what the dolls sit on top of. Unknown or unsure: Whether the dolls sit on the table. Plan: I need to locate the dolls first.)

Thought(Analyze the result: Only one bounding box is detected. Plan: Crop the image on the bounding box. The index argument is set to 0 since I crop on BOX0[0].)
Implement(IMAGE0=CROP(image=IMAGE,box=BOX0,index=0))

The image shows a long table covered with a yellow tablecloth. On the table, there are various items such as toys, books, and other decorative items. The table is set up in a room with a gray wall and a green curtain in the background.

Thought(Analyze the result: There is a table in the cropped image. I know the dolls sit on the table. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks which kind of furniture do the dolls sit on top of. Since I already know the dolls are sitting on the table, the answer is the table.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='The dolls sit on top of the table.'))
