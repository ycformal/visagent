multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx427h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a modern bathroom with a walk-in shower. On the left side of the shower, there are two wooden cabinets with a white countertop and a wooden vanity with a sink and a mirror above it. The overall color scheme of the bathroom is neutral and modern."

Q="Are the books to the left or to the right of the wood cabinet?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main objects in the question are the books and the cabinet. I need to locate them and figure out their relative position. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions two wooden cabinets, but does not mention any book. Unknown or unsure: The position of books and their relative position to the cabinets. Plan: I need to locate the books first.)

[[1, 257, 65, 283], [1, 263, 39, 273]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There are two bounding boxes, I need to judge the size and position of them to find if there are wrong detections. Judge the size: The size for two bounding boxes are 64x26 and 38x10. The second one has a height of 10 pixels and is too small. It is safe to only focus on the first bounding box. Plan: Get the position of cabinets.)

</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There are four bounding boxes, I need to judge the size and position of them to find if there are wrong detections. Judge the size: The size for four bounding boxes are 155x128, 25x35, 138x165 and 81x173 The second one has a width of 25 pixels and is too small. Plan: For the remaining bounding boxes, remove small bounding boxes that are included in a larger one.)
Implement(BOX2=FILTER_INCLUDED(box='[[123, 253, 278, 381], [0, 259, 138, 426], [125, 264, 206, 379]]'))
<result>
[[123, 253, 278, 381], [0, 259, 138, 426]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: Two bounding boxes remained. Plan: Judge the relative position of the books and the cabinets. (1+65)/2=33, so the center of the books' bounding box is (33,*). For cabinets, I need to combine the two bounding boxes to a larger one: [0, 253, 278, 426]. (0+278)/2=139. Since 33<139, I know the books are to the left of the cabinets. I can give the answer. The question asks are the books to the left or to the right of the wood cabinet, and I know the books are to the left. So the answer is left.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='The books are to the left of the cabinet.))
