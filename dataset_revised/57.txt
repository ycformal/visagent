Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the group of animals. I need to locate them and figure what animals are there. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions a few birds in the sky. This corresponds to "animals" mentioned in the question. Unknown or unsure: Nothing. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks what is the name of these animals, and I know there are birds, so the answer is bird.)
