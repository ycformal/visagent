multimodal input: IMAGE (427wx640h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a young woman sitting at a wooden table with a large pizza in front of her. She is smiling and looking at the camera. The pizza is topped with melted cheese, bacon, and a fried egg."

Q="Who is wearing a shirt?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the shirt. I need to locate the shirt and figure out who is wearing. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions a woman but I don't know what she is wearing. Unknown or unsure: Is the woman wearing a shirt? Plan: I need to locate the woman first.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='woman'))
<result>
[[162, 11, 372, 333]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is only one bounding box. No steps need to be taken to filter false detections. Plan: Crop the image on the bounding box. The index argument is set to 0 since I crop on BOX0[0].)
Implement(IMAGE0=CROP(image=IMAGE,box=BOX0,index=0))
<result>
The image shows a young woman sitting at a table with a plate of food in front of her. She is smiling and looking at the camera. The woman is wearing a gray cardigan and a purple top.
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is a woman wearing a cardigan. I don't know whether the woman is wearing a shirt because the caption module may recognize a shirt as a cardigan. Plan: Ask VQA whether the woman is wearing a shirt.)
Implement(ANSWER0=VQA(image=IMAGE0,question='Is the woman wearing a shirt?'))
<result>
yes
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: the VQA gives "yes", which means the woman is wearing a shirt. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks who is wearing the shirt, and I know the woman is wearing the shirt, so the answer is the woman.)
Implement(ANSWER1=RESULT(var='The woman is wearing the shirt.'))
