multimodal input: IMAGE (334wx500h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a young man standing in a coffee shop. In front of him, there is a black bicycle leaning against a wooden shelf. On the shelf, there are various coffee machines and coffee beans. The background shows a counter with a coffee machine and other coffee-related items."

Q="Which kind of furniture is the coffee cup on?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the coffee cup. I need to locate it and figure out the furniture it is on. Analyze the caption: From the caption, I know there is a shelf with coffee machines and coffee beans. I think this is accurate because shelves are easy to recognize and the caption module will not be wrong on this. The coffee cup is very likely to be on the shelf. Unknown or unsure: I'm not sure whether my inference is correct. Plan: Locate the coffee cups.)

[[103, 122, 124, 142], [301, 80, 312, 103], [131, 242, 141, 260], [323, 14, 332, 29], [281, 61, 305, 104], [83, 122, 105, 146], [137, 246, 145, 265], [120, 162, 142, 184], [316, 82, 333, 102], [63, 123, 83, 146], [48, 274, 59, 299], [314, 19, 322, 28], [133, 116, 147, 139], [138, 163, 143, 172], [328, 28, 333, 56], [285, 148, 293, 161]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There are too many bounding boxes. It is hard to filter by size because there should be a lot of coffee cups in the coffee shop, and cups that are distant from the camera should be small. Plan: Give up cropping on bounding boxes. Directly ask VQA whether the coffee cups are on the shelf.)
Implement(ANSWER0=VQA(image=IMAGE,question='Are coffee cups on the shelf?'))
<result>
yes
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The VQA gives "yes", which means the coffee cups are on the shelf. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks which kind of furniture is the coffee cup on. I know the cup is on the shelf, so the answer is the shelf.)
Implement(ANSWER1=RESULT(var='The coffee cup is on the shelf.'))
