multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx427h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows two men standing next to a brown horse on a dirt path in a wooded area. There are several other bags and equipment scattered around the path, including a backpack and a camera. In the background, there are trees and bushes, and the sky is blue and clear."

Q="What type of animal are the trees in front of?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the group of trees. I need to locate where the group of trees figure out animals the trees in front of. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions a horse and trees. Unknown or unsure: Whether the trees are in front of the horse. Plan: Locate the horse.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='horse'))
<result>
[[88, 133, 381, 346]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is only one bounding box. Plan: Crop the horse to ask VQA about the direction the horse is facing, so that I can understand "in front of". Set index=0 since I want to crop on BOX0[0].)
Implement(IMAGE0=CROP(image=IMAGE,box=BOX0,index=0))
<result>
The image shows two men standing next to a brown horse on a dirt path in a wooded area. There is a blue backpack on the ground next to the horse. The background shows a wooden fence and trees.
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: No information about the direction the horse is facing. Plan: Ask VQA about the direction the horse is facing.)
Implement(ANSWER0=VQA(image=IMAGE0,question='Which direction is the horse facing?'))
<result>
right
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The horse is facing to the right. Plan: I need to crop the right of the horse to locate the trees. The index is set to 0 because I want to crop on BOX0[0].)
Implement(IMAGE1=CROP_RIGHTOF(image=IMAGE,box=BOX0,index=1))
<result>
The image shows two young men standing next to a wooden fence with a horse in the background. The background shows a mountain range with trees and bushes. The sky is blue and the overall scene is peaceful and serene.
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: I know there are trees in the cropped image. Therefore, the trees are in front of the horse. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks the type of animal that the trees are in front of. I know the trees are in front a horse. So the answer is horse.)
Implement(ANSWER1=RESULT(var='The horse.'))
