multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx427h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows two elderly people sitting on a wooden bench at a beach. The person on the left is wearing a beige jacket and a cap, and the person in the middle is holding a pink umbrella with a floral pattern. The umbrella is open and the people are looking out towards the horizon."

Q="Is there an umbrella in the picture that is not closed?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is umbrella. I need to find if there is an open umbrella. Analyze the caption: The umbrella is mentioned in the caption and it is open. Unknown or unsure: Nothing. Plan: I can directly give the yes answer. The question asks whether the umbrella is not closed, and I know it is open, so the answer is yes.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='yes'))
