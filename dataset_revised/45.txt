multimodal input: IMAGE (500wx377h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a group of people gathered around a row of motorcycles. There are six people in the image, three men and three women, all wearing red bandanas and sunglasses. The people are looking at the motorcycles and appear to be engaged in conversation."

Q="Who seems to be older, the woman or the girl?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main objects in the question are the woman and the girl. I need to locate them and figure out their age. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions there are six people, three men and three women. Unknow or unsure: The age of the woman and the girl. Plan: Call LOC to locate the woman.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='woman'))

</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There are multiple bounding boxes detected and I need to filter wrong detections. Judge the size: The sizes for the bounding boxes are 42x140, 49x92, 90x114, 156x202, 65x76, 114x135, 39x70. They are of normal sizes. Plan: Filter small bounding boxes that are heavily overlapped with larger one.)

</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: Six bounding boxes remained, corresponding to six people. Obviously the LOC module recognizes men as women. Plan: Merge the bounding boxes to a larger one, crop on the merged bounding box and directly ask VQA. min{141, 60, 94, 280, 230, 107}=60, min{136, 139, 164, 174, 132, 124}=124, max{183, 109, 186, 436, 344, 146}=436, max{276, 231, 278, 376, 267, 194}=376. The merged bounding box is [60, 124, 436, 376]. I need to assign it to BOX2.)
Implement(BOX2=EVAL(expr='[[60, 124, 436, 376]]'))
<result>
[[60, 124, 436, 376]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: BOX2 is successfully assigned. Plan: Crop on BOX2[0].)
Implement(IMAGE0=CROP(image=IMAGE,box=BOX2,index=0))
<result>
The image shows a group of people gathered around a row of motorcycles. There are six people in the image, all wearing red bandanas and sunglasses. The people around the motorcycles appear to be engaged in conversation.
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There are six people. Plan: Ask VQA who seems to be older.)
Implement(ANSWER0=VQA(image=IMAGE0,question='Who seems to be older, the woman or the girl?'))
<result>
man
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: VQA doesn't understand the question. Plan: Paraphrase and ask again. Ask is the woman older or the girl older.)
Implement(ANSWER1=VQA(image=IMAGE0,question='Is the woman older or the girl older?'))
<result>
older
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: VQA is still wrong. Plan: I guess woman is older because in English, "woman" is often older than "girl". Ask VQA if the woman is older than the girl.)
Implement(ANSWER2=VQA(image=IMAGE0,question='Is the woman older than the girl?'))
<result>
yes
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The woman is indeed older. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks which one seems to be older, and I know the woman is probably older than the girl, so the answer is woman.)
Implement(ANSWER3=RESULT(var='The woman is older than the girl.'))
