multimodal input: IMAGE (426wx640h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows two young men standing in front of a wall with orange panels. The man on the left is wearing a white sweatshirt with the word "AQUA" written on it and beige pants. He is holding a white remote control in his hand and appears to be playing a video game. The other man is standing next to him, wearing a black t-shirt with a graphic of a skull and crossbones on it. Both men are wearing glasses and appear to be engaged in a conversation. The wall behind them has a red logo that reads "RUSH"."

Q="Does the tall person look Asian?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the two young men. I need to locate them and figure out if the tall person is Asian. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions two men. Unknown or unsure: Whether the tall person is Asian. Plan: I need to locate the two men first.)

Thought(Analyze the result: There are three bounding boxes. I need to filter out the wrong detections. Judge the size: The sizes are 108x353, 151x408 and 48x278. They are of normal size. Plan: Remove small bounding boxes that are included in a larger one.)
Implement(BOX1=FILTER_INCLUDED(box='[[82, 215, 190, 568], [251, 230, 402, 638], [377, 361, 425, 639]]'))

Thought(Analyze the result: There's no bounding box removed. Plan: The first bounding box is the tallest. Crop on BOX1[0] because the question is asking about the tall man.)

<result>
The image shows a young man standing in front of a large orange wall. He is wearing a white sweatshirt with the word "AQUA" written on it in black letters. He has a pair of beige pants and black shoes. The man is holding a white remote control in his right hand and appears to be looking at it intently. The floor is covered with a gray carpet.
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is indeed a man. Plan: Ask VQA whether he is Asian.)
Implement(ANSWER0=VQA(image=IMAGE0,question='Is the man Asian?'))
<result>
yes
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The VQA says the man is Asian. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks whether the tall person looks Asian. I know the man in the image is Asian, so the answer is yes.)
Implement(ANSWER1=RESULT(var='Yes, the person is asian.'))
