multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx427h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows an Oman Air airplane taking off from an airport runway. In the background, there is a hill covered in trees and a red crane can be seen in the distance. The sky is blue and the weather appears to be clear."

Q="Do the green trees look tall and dense?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the group of trees. I need to locate them and figure out if they are tall and dense. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions a hill covered in trees. Unknown or unsure: Whether the trees are tall and dense. Plan: I need to locate the trees first.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='trees'))
<result>
[[402, 138, 492, 209], [0, 73, 637, 222]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There are two bounding boxes, and I need to filter wrong detections. Judge the size: The sizes are 90x71 and 637x149. Both of them are of normal size. Plan: Remove small bounding boxes that are included in a larger one.)
Implement(BOX1=FILTER_INCLUDED(box='[[402, 138, 492, 209], [0, 73, 637, 222]]'))
<result>
[[0, 73, 637, 222]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: Only one bounding box remained. Plan: Crop on this bounding box. Set index=0 because I want to crop on BOX1[0].)
Implement(IMAGE0=CROP(image=IMAGE,box=BOX1,index=0))
<result>
The image shows an Oman Air airplane on the runway. In the background, there is a green landscape with trees and hills. On the right side of the image, there are buildings and a red crane. The sky is blue and the weather appears to be sunny.
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: From the caption, I know there are green trees, so I cropped the right region. Plan: Ask VQA with the question "Are the trees tall?".)
Implement(ANSWER0=VQA(image=IMAGE0,question='Are the trees tall?'))
<result>
yes
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The VQA gives "yes", which means the trees are tall. Plan: I also need to ask if the trees are dense. The question is "Are the trees dense?".)
Implement(ANSWER1=VQA(image=IMAGE0,question='Are the trees dense?'))
<result>
yes
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The VQA gives "yes" again, which means the trees are dense. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks if the green trees look tall and dense. I know they are tall and dense, so the answer is yes.)
Implement(ANSWER2=RESULT(var='yes'))
