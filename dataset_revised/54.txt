multimodal input: IMAGE (500wx333h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a young woman lying on a bed with her legs crossed. The bed is covered with a blue and white striped comforter and there is an orange blanket on the left side of the bed. There are two pillows on the bed and a window with white blinds in the background."

Q="Is she on a bench?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the woman. I need to locate her and figure out whether she is on a bench. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions the woman, and she is lying on a bed. I'm sure the caption won't recognize a bench as bed because the layout is also more like a bed. Unknown or unsure: Nothing. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks whether she is on a bench. Since she is on a bed, the answer is no.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='No, the woman is on the bed.'))
