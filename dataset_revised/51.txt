CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a young girl sitting on a bed. She is wearing a pink long-sleeved shirt with a cartoon character on it. The girl has blonde curly hair and is holding a pink blanket in her hands. She appears to be looking down at the blanket with a sad expression on her face. In the background, there is a doll lying on the bed and a lamp on the nightstand."

Q="Are there blankets that are not brown?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the blanket. I need to find the blanket or blankets and figure out their colors. Analyze the caption: the blanket and it is pink. Unknown or unsure: Nothing. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks if there are blankets that are not brown. I already know there is a pink blanket, so the answer is yes.)
