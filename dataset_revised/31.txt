multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx428h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a baseball game in progress. The batter is at home plate and is in the process of swinging his bat. He is wearing a white uniform with the number 27 on it and a red helmet. The catcher is crouched behind home plate, ready to catch the ball. The umpire is standing on the right side of the image, watching the play closely."

Q="Are there any helmets or rackets that are red?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main objects in the question are helmets and rackets. I need to find if there are red helmets or rackets. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions the helmet and mentions it is red. Unknown or unsure: Nothing. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks whether there are helmets or rackets that are red, and I already know there is a red helmet, so the answer is yes.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='Yes, there is a red helmet.'))
