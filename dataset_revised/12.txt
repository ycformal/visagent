multimodal input: IMAGE (500wx500h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a young boy running on a street with a colorful kite in the air. The street is lined with trees and there is a white garage door on the right side of the image. There is a trash can and a green bag on the ground next to the garage door. The sky is blue and there are a few clouds in the background."

Q="Do you see any fences that are not made of brick?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is fence. I need to locate the fence and figure whether it is made of brick. Analyze the caption: From the caption, there is no information about the fence. Unknown or unsure: Where is the fence and whether it is made of brick. Plan: First call LOC to locate the fence.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='fence'))
<result>
[[30, 226, 52, 302], [138, 198, 347, 368]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There are two bounding boxes, I need to judge the size of them to find if there are wrong detections. Judge the size: The size for two bounding boxes are 22x76 and 209x170. The first one has a width of 22 pixels and is too narrow compared to the second one. Ignore it. Plan: Crop on the second bounding box. The index argument is set to 1 since I want to crop on BOX0[1].)
Implement(IMAGE0=CROP(image=IMAGE,box=BOX0,index=1))
<result>
The image shows a young child, probably around 2-3 years old, standing on the side of a street. The street is lined with trees and there is a white garage door on the right side of the image. The sky is overcast and the ground is wet, suggesting that it has recently rained.
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: I know the size and position of the bounding box, but there is no information about the fence. Plan: Call LOC to locate the fence on the new image to ensure there is a fence.)
Implement(BOX1=LOC(image=IMAGE0,object='fence'))
<result>
[[33, 44, 261, 214]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is only one bounding box. Now I know I've cropped the right region. Plan: Call VQA to ask whether the fence is made of brick.)
Implement(ANSWER0=VQA(image=IMAGE0,question='Is the fence made of brick?'))
<result>
yes
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The answer is yes, which means the fence is made of brick. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks whether I see any fences that are not made of brick. I know there is a fence, but it is made of brick. So the answer is no.)
Implement(ANSWER1=RESULT(var='No, there is a fence but it is made of brick.'))
