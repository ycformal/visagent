multimodal input: IMAGE (500wx300h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a vast open field with a few hills in the background. In the foreground, there is a brown cow standing on the right side of the image. On the left side, there are two black and white dogs, one of which is a Jack Russell Terrier. The dog is standing on all fours and is looking towards the camera."

Q="Are the animals dogs?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the animals. I need to locate animals and figure out if there are dogs. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions a cow and dogs. Unknown or unsure: Nothing. I can give the answer. The question asks if the animals are dogs, and I know there are both dogs and cows, so the answer is no.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='No, there are both dogs and cows.'))
