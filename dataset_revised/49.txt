It is unclear if there are both men and women in the scene.
multimodal input: IMAGE (454wx640h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a young man performing a skateboard trick on a wooden ramp. He is wearing a white t-shirt, blue jeans, and black shoes. His skateboard is black and he is in mid-air, with his left leg extended behind him and his right leg bent at the knee. His arms are stretched out to the sides and his head is tilted back, as if he is about to land on the skateboard. In the background, there are people walking on the sidewalk and a tall building with glass windows. The sky is overcast and there are trees and bushes in the background."

Q="Are there both men and women in the scene?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main objects in the question are men and women. I need to find if there are men and women. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions a man. Unknown or unsure: Whether there are women. Plan: I need to locate the woman.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='woman'))

</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: A lot of bounding boxes are detected. However, I don't need to filter out wrong detections because I only need to know if there is a woman instead of cropping on the woman and get the detailed information. Since so many bounding boxes are detected, there must be at least one bounding box containing a woman. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks whether there are both men and woman in the scene. I know there is a man and at least a woman, so the answer is yes.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='Yes, there are both a woman and a man.'))
