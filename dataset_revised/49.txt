CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a young man performing a skateboard trick on a wooden ramp. He is wearing a white t-shirt, blue jeans, and black shoes. His skateboard is black and he is in mid-air, with his left leg extended behind him and his right leg bent at the knee. His arms are stretched out to the sides and his head is tilted back, as if he is about to land on the skateboard. In the background, there are people walking on the sidewalk and a tall building with glass windows. The sky is overcast and there are trees and bushes in the background."

Q="Are there both men and women in the scene?"
