multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx427h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a vase of white roses on a wooden table in a living room. In the background, there are two people standing in the living room, one of them is holding a cup of coffee and the other is looking at the roses. The room is decorated with a brick fireplace, a couch, and a bookshelf. The floor is covered with a red carpet."

Q="What is in front of the bricks?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the bricks. I need to locate the bricks and figure out what is in front of them. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions a brick fireplace. Unknow or unsure: what is in front of the bricks. Plan: I need to locate the group of bricks first. Since I know they form a fireplace, I will locate fireplace for better accuracy.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='fireplace'))

[[267, 2, 534, 210]]

Thought(Analyze the result: One bounding box is detected. Plan: Crop the region of the second bounding box. The index argument is set to 0 since I want to crop on BOX0[0].)
Implement(IMAGE0=CROP(image=IMAGE,box=BOX0,index=0))
<result>
The image shows a bunch of white roses in a vase on a table. In the background, there is a brick wall and a wooden chair. On the left side, there are two people standing and one person is holding a cup of coffee. The image appears to be taken in a room with a brick fireplace.
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: From the caption of IMAGE0, I know there is a brick wall and a wooden chair in the background. The chair seems to be the object that is closest to the wall. Plan: verify there is indeed a chair in IMAGE0 using LOC.)
Implement(BOX1=LOC(image=IMAGE0,object='chair'))
<result>
[[131, 103, 263, 209], [0, 120, 26, 176], [262, 79, 390, 261]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is at least one chair. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks what is in front of the bricks, and I know there is a fireplace made of bricks and a chair is in front of the fireplace, so the answer is the chair.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='The chair is in front of the bricks.'))
