multimodal input: IMAGE (500wx333h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a herd of elephants walking through a dry grassy field. There are around 10 elephants in total, with a large number of them in the foreground and a few smaller ones in the background. The elephants are walking in a line, with some in the front and some behind them."

Q="Which direction is the gray elephant facing?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the gray elephant. I need to locate elephants and focus on the gray one. Analyze the caption: The caption mentions there is a herd of elephants. Unknown or unsure: Where is the gray one and the direction it is facing. Plan: I need to locate elephants first.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='elephant'))
<result>
[[5, 104, 499, 253]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is only one bounding box. It should include a herd of elephants. Plan: Crop on BOX[0] to ask questions about the elephant.)
Implement(IMAGE0=CROP(image=IMAGE,box=BOX0,index=0))

Thought(Analyze the result: There's a herd of elephants, but I don't know the direction the gray elephant is facing. Plan: Ask VQA on IMAGE0.)
Implement(ANSWER0=VQA(image=IMAGE0,question='Which direction is the gray elephant facing?'))
<result>
left
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: the VQA gives "left". Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks about the direction the gray elephant is facing. From VQA, I know it is facing to the left. So the answer is left.)
Implement(ANSWER1=RESULT(var='left'))
